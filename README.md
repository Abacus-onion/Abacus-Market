    <p>Abacus is one of the most innovative and feature-rich markets. Launched in 2021, it features Bitcoin, Escrow, XMR, FE, and Multisig.</p>
    <h2>About Abacus Market</h2>
    <p>Abacus Market is a new platform that was previously named Alphabet Market and was styled to resemble the now-shuttered Alphabay Market. In October 2021, Alphabay Market relaunched, and Alphabet Market rebranded as Abacus Market to avoid confusion.</p>
    <p>Abacus Market is a complete marketplace solution, coded 100% from scratch, offering escrow and multisig payments in Bitcoin or Monero.</p>
    <h3>Vendor Policies</h3>
    <p>Vendor bonds are waived for vendors with more than 100 sales and a minimum of 75% positive feedback. All vendors are reviewed by Abacus staff to avoid scammers. Trusted vendors may gain early privileges for finalizing transactions.</p>
    <h3>Our Code of Conduct</h3>
    <p>You may be shocked to find listings here that are outlawed in your jurisdiction. However, that doesn't mean Abacus is lawless. We have a very strict code of conduct, which we believe most people would agree with if given the chance. Our rules are based on treating others as you would like to be treated, not scamming others on the market, and minding your own business.</p>
    <h3>Our Stance on the War on Drugs</h3>
    <p>Abacus Market is firmly against the War on Drugs, a movement that has been widely questioned across the world. The War on Drugs has only resulted in deaths, abuse of power, and wasted public funds. We are against limiting people's access to controlled substances that they choose to obtain. Unfortunately, many people are forced to buy from the streets without knowing what they’re getting, losing out on the ability to share information with others in similar situations.</p>
    <h3>Harm Reduction Efforts</h3>
    <p>We have many plans related to harm reduction. Some of our closest friends have tragically died from overdoses caused by adulterated substances that they didn’t know they were taking. We encourage all buyers to learn about lethal doses of substances and not trust anyone. It's crucial to buy your own testing kits or send samples to your nearest testing lab to ensure the safety of what you're purchasing. If we find that any seller is offering adulterated substances, they will be permanently banned from our platform, and their customers will be immediately warned.</p>
    <h3>Personal Responsibility</h3>
    <p>The old saying, “With freedom comes responsibility,” couldn’t be more true here. While you may find easy access to things that could get you into trouble with authorities or harm your health, just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Ultimately, you are the owner of your life, and it’s your responsibility to judge what is good or bad for you. No one else can make that decision for you.</p>
